This folder is where the static assets will live.
These assets are ones that should live in the root folder of the site.


## Static files
- favicon
- serviceworker.js
- manifest.webmanifest or manifest.json
- sitemap.xml
- robots.txt

## Make sure 11ty copies these to the root of the output folder, not to a `/static` subfolder of it (which it does by default)
These assets are moved to the root of the output folder `_site` by configuring eleventy in `.eleventy.js`:

```
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy({ static: "/" })
}
```
