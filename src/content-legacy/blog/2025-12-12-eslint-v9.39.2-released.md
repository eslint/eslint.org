## Highlights

This release prints a warning message when an `/* eslint-env */` configuration comment is found in the code being linted. The warning includes the filename and line number of the comment, along with instructions on how to replace it. The purpose of this warning is to allow for a smoother migration, since starting with ESLint v10.0.0, `/* eslint-env */` comments are reported as errors by the linter, as explained in the [migration guide](/docs/next/use/migrate-to-10.0.0#-eslint-env-comments-are-reported-as-errors).
