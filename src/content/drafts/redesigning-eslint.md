Hi! My name's Hayden. I'm a designer and developer and, until recently, I ran a little agency called [Jellypepper](https://jellypepper.com).

We were fortunate enough to work with the ESLint team on their new brand and website. I'm a huge fan of ESLint and use it every day, even going to the effort of writing my own [600-line ESLint config](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/harmony) to use across all my React, Next.js and Expo projects.

[Nicholas](https://github.com/nzakas) originally reached out to us on Twitter to kick off the largest project the ESLint team has taken on in its nine years of existence. He wanted to create a stronger brand identity for the ESLint team and its community, and make the website more functional, easier to navigate, and more useful to everyone from new users to established users. 

> Hi Hayden, I wanted to say thanks for the donation to ESLint. As it so happens, the project is looking for a bit of a rebrand (keep the logo, change everything else) and website redesign, so I was wondering if you‚Äôd be interested. It just seemed like a potentially good match.

This was a bit of a dream project for me üòÖ So, needless to say, we were totally in.

## The Brand

The ESLint Brand is an interesting one - without too much official visual design, the team have managed to create a brand that is unique and widely recognized by the developer community.

### The Logo

The logomark is at the core of ESLint's brand identity and one of the most identifiable pieces. It‚Äôs a connection to their ecosystem - you can find it everywhere, from IDE marketplaces to corporate sponsorship pages across the web. It carries with it the expectation of a community of developers who are passionate about the code they write.

While we kept the icon (given its widespread usage in websites, IDEs, platforms and projects), we wanted to make it that little bit more refined, modern and flexible. By bringing it together our new primary typeface, Space Grotesk (more on this below), we created a new ESLint logomark. Due to its simplicity, it works in a variety of colours and spaces.

### The Typeface

Typography is at the heart of the new ESLint brand - they're a very content-driven organisation. The website, docs, blog all need require great typography to be readable and enjoyable. The brand leverages a purposeful set of typographic styles, designed to make our content as accessible as possible for everyone.

From a technical point of view, we wanted fonts that are widely accessible and conveniently located, so we‚Äôll have access to it everywhere (particularly on other Google products) and it fits with our free and open-source ‚Äúvibe‚Äù.

We decided to go with [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk) ‚Äî a fantastic, characteristic font that balances that flair with the technical geometric elements that reflect their more developer-centric side. It creates character with its idiosyncratic details that share principles with the logomark and brings life and energy to the brand by showcasing its more technical details.

Space Grotesk works hand-in-hand with it‚Äôs origin sister font, Space Mono. It was developed for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s, many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.
