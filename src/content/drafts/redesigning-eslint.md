Hi! My name's Hayden. I'm a designer and developer and, until recently, I ran a little agency called [Jellypepper](https://jellypepper.com).

We were fortunate enough to work with the ESLint team on their new brand and website. I'm a huge fan of ESLint and use it every day, even going to the effort of writing my own [600-line ESLint config](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/harmony) to use across all my React, Next.js and Expo projects.

[Nicholas](https://github.com/nzakas) originally reached out to us on Twitter to kick off the largest project the ESLint team has taken on in its nine years of existence. He wanted to create a stronger brand identity for the ESLint team and its community, and make the website more functional, easier to navigate, and more useful to everyone from new users to established users. 

> Hi Hayden, I wanted to say thanks for the donation to ESLint. As it so happens, the project is looking for a bit of a rebrand (keep the logo, change everything else) and website redesign, so I was wondering if youâ€™d be interested. It just seemed like a potentially good match.

This was a bit of a dream project for me ðŸ˜… So, needless to say, we were totally in.
