![Trunk Donates to ESLint](/assets/images/blog-covers/sponsorship-trunk.png)

We are happy to share that [Trunk](https://trunk.io/) has become an ESLint gold sponsor, donating $1,000 each month for the ongoing maintenance and development of ESLint! Trunk is a suite of tools aimed at making developers more effective, including [Code Quality](https://trunk.io/code-quality) that integrates ESLint directly, and [Merge Queue](https://trunk.io/merge-queue), with more tools in development.

Here's what the folks at Trunk had to say about ESLint:

> "ESLint is a core part of the Trunk Code Quality plugin ecosystem. It's the most popular linter plugin and is enabled by default on all JS and TS projects running Code Quality. ESLint also runs on all of Trunk's Typescript source code.
>
> Code Quality, as a metalinter, is built on top of great open-source linters like ESLint. Sponsoring ESLint and helping ESLint leverage Trunk Code Quality on their open-source repo is an excellent way for us to give back."
>
> -- David Apirian, Trunk Co-founder

The ESLint team and the Trunk team worked together over the past few months to integrate [Code Quality into the ESLint repository](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/18643), where it now runs ESLint on itself, as well as several other linters. Throughout this process, we've worked to ensure that ESLint and Code Quality work well together across a variety of scenarios.

ESLint is grateful for the support of the Trunk team as they used ESLint in their commercial products. Donations from companies like Trunk allow ESLint to pay contributors for ongoing maintenance and development.
