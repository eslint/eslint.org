## Highlights

This version of ESLint is not ready for production use and is provided to gather feedback from the community before releasing the final version. Please let us know if you have any problems or feedback by creating issues on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

Note that this prerelease version of ESLint has a [separate documentation section](/docs/next/).

### Notable bug fixes

* A [regression](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20451) in the core [`strict`](/docs/next/rules/strict) rule has been fixed.
* `LegacyESLint` and `FlatESLint` exports are now completely removed from the `/use-at-your-own-risk` entrypoint. In previous prerelease versions of ESLint v10, they were exported as `null`.

### Installing

Since this is a pre-release version, you will not automatically be upgraded by npm. You must specify the `next` tag when installing:

```
npm i eslint@next --save-dev
```

You can also specify the version directly:

```
npm i eslint@10.0.0-rc.2 --save-dev
```

### Migration Guide

As there are a lot of changes, we've created a [migration guide](/docs/next/use/migrate-to-10.0.0) describing the breaking changes in great detail along with the steps you should take to address them. We expect that most users should be able to upgrade without any build changes, but the migration guide should be a useful resource if you encounter problems.
