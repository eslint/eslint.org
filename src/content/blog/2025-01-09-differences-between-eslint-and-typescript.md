If you're a JavaScript developer today, there's a good chance you're using a combination of ESLint and TypeScript to assist development.
These tools perform similar but different functions. ESLint is a *linter*, whereas TypeScript is a *type checker*.

Linters and type checkers are two kinds of *static analysis* tooling that analyze code and report on detected issues. While they may seem similar at first, linters and type checkers detect different categories of issues and are useful in different ways.

To understand these differences, it's first helpful to understand what static analysis is and why it's useful.

## What is static analysis?

Static analysis is the inspection of source code without executing it.
This differs from *dynamic analysis*, in which source code is inspected while it is executed.
As such, dynamic analysis brings with it the inherent danger of executing malicious code or creating side effects while static analysis is safe to execute regardless of the source code.

Static analysis can be immensely helpful for improving code readability, reliability, and overall quality.
Many developers rely on static analysis to enforce consistent code formatting and style, to ensure code is well-documented, and to catch likely bugs.
Because static analysis runs on source code, it can suggest improvements in editors as code is written.

ESLint's static analysis is organized as a series of individually configured lint rules. Because no two rules interact with one another, you can safely turn each rule on and off depending on your preferences. While TypeScript has some individually configured options, the majority of the analysis is performed in the type checking functionality.

ESLint and TypeScript use some of the same forms of analysis to detect defects in code.
They both analyze how scopes and variables are created and used in code, and can catch issues such as referencing a variable that doesn't exist.
We'll explore the different ways the two use information from analyzing your code.

## Digging deeper into linting vs. type checking

Linters primarily report likely defects and can also be used to enforce subjective opinions.
ESLint and other linters catch issues that may or may not be type-safe but are potential sources of bugs.
Many developers rely on linters to make sure their code follows framework and language best practices.

For example, developers sometimes leave out the `break` or `return` at the end of a `switch` statement's `case`.
Doing so is type-safe and permitted by JavaScript and TypeScript.
In practice, this is almost always a mistake that allows the next `case` statement to run accidentally.
ESLint's [`no-fallthrough`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-fallthrough) can catch that likely mistake:

```ts
function logFruit(value: "apple" | "banana" | "cherry") {
    switch (value) {
        case "apple":
            console.log("üçè");
            break;

        case "banana":
            console.log("üçå");

        // eslint(no-fallthrough):
        // Expected a 'break' statement before 'case'.

        case "cherry":
            console.log("üçí");
            break;
    }
}

// Logs:
// üçå
// üçí
logFruit("banana");
```

Type checkers, on the other hand, ensure that values are used only in ways that are allowed by the value's type. Compiled languages, like Java, perform type checking during the compilation phase. Because JavaScript has no way to indicate the intended type of a binding, it cannot perform type checking on its own. That's where TypeScript comes in.

By allowing explicit type annotations (and the implicit detection of some types), TypeScript overlays type information on top of JavaScript code to perform type checking similar to what's found in compiled languages.
For example, TypeScript reports a type error on the following `logUppercase(9001)` call, because `logUppercase` is declared to receive a `string` rather than a `number`:

```ts
function logUppercase(text: string) {
    console.log(text.toUpperCase());
}

logUppercase(9001);
//           ~~~~
// Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

TypeScript focuses on reporting known errors rather than potential problems; there is nothing subjective about the errors that TypeScript reports, nor is there a way to implement project-specific preferences.

Another way of looking at the differences between ESLint and¬†TypeScript is that TypeScript enforces what you *can* do, whereas ESLint enforces what you *should* do.

### Granular extensibility

Another difference between ESLint and TypeScript is in granularity of configuration.

ESLint runs with a set of individually configurable lint rules. If you don't like a particular lint rule, you can turn it off for a line, set of files, or your entire project.
ESLint can also be augmented by **plugins** that add new lint rules.
Plugin-specific lint rules extend the breadth of code checks that ESLint configurations can pick and choose from.

For example, this ESLint configuration enables the recommended rules from [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), a plugin that adds checks for accessibility in projects using JSX libraries such as Solid.js and React:

```js title="eslint.config.js"
import js from "@eslint/js";
import jsxA11y from "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y"

export default [
    js.configs.recommended,
    jsxA11y.flatConfigs.recommended,
    // ...
];
```

A project using the JSX accessibility rules would then be told if their code violates common accessibility guidelines.
For example, rendering a native `<img>` tag without descriptive text would receive a report from [`jsx-a11y/alt-text`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/main/docs/rules/alt-text.md):

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => <img src="source.webp" />;
//                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// eslint(jsx-a11y/alt-text):
// img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.
```

By adding in rules from plugins, ESLint configurations can be tailored to the specific best practices and common issues to the frameworks a project is built with.

TypeScript, on the other hand, is configured by a set list of compiler options on a project level.
The [`tsconfig.json` file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) allows you to set compiler options that change type checking for all files in the project.
Those compiler options are set globally for TypeScript and generally change large swathes of type checking behavior.
TypeScript does not allow compiler options to be different across different files in a single project.

### Areas of overlap

While ESLint and TypeScript operate differently and specialize in different areas of code defects, there is some overlap. Specific types of code defects straddle the line between "best practices" and "type safety," and so can be caught by both tools.

We recommend using both ESLint and TypeScript in your TypeScript projects to ensure you're catching the widest number and types of defects. Here are a few steps to get you started:

* In your ESLint configuration file, use:
  * the [ESLint `js.configs.recommended` config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started#configuration)
  * the [`tseslint.configs.recommended` config from typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started)
  * any community plugins relevant to your project's libraries and frameworks
* In your TypeScript configuration file, enable [`strict` mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) to catch as many type safety issues as possible

**Note:** typescript-eslint's `tseslint.configs.recommended` disable core ESLint rules¬†that are not helpful with TypeScript.
The config leaves on any core ESLint rules that are useful alongside type checking.

#### Unused locals and parameters

The only TypeScript compiler options we recommend keeping off when using linting are those that enable checking for unused variables:

* [`noUnusedLocals`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUnusedLocals) - reports on unused declared local variables
* [`noUnusedParameters`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#noUnusedParameters) - reports on unused function parameters

These compiler options are useful when not using ESLint.
However, they aren't configurable the way lint rules are, and so can't be configured to higher or lower strictness levels based on a project's preferences.
For example, the compiler options are hardcoded to always ignore any variable whose name begins with `_` while ESLint's `no-unused-vars` doesn't treat these variables any differently until configured to do so.

As an example, the following `registerCallback` function declares two parameters for its callbacks, `id`, and `message`, but the developer using it only needed `message`.
TypeScript's `noUnusedParameters` compiler option would not flag the unused parameter `_`:

```ts
type Callback = (id: string, message: string) => void;

declare function registerCallback(callback: Callback): void;

// We only want to log message, not id
registerCallback((_, message) => console.log(message));
```

Unused variables in JavaScript can also be caught by ESLint's [`no-unused-vars`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-unused-vars) rule; when in TypeScript code, the [`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-unused-vars) is preferable instead.
The lint rules can be configured to ignore variables whose name begins with `_`.

Additionally, the lint rules by default ignore parameters that come before any parameter that is itself used.
Some projects prefer to never allow unused parameters regardless of name or position.
These stricter preferences help prevent API designs that lead developers to create many unused parameters.

A more strict ESLint configuration would be able to report on the `_` parameter:

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars: ["error", { "args": "all", "argsIgnorePattern": "" }] */

type Callback = (id: string, message: string) => void;

declare function registerCallback(callback: Callback): void;

// We only want to log message, not id
registerCallback((_, message) => console.log(message));
//                ~
// eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars):
// '_' is declared but never used.
```

That extra level of configurability provided by the `no-unused-vars` rules allows them to act¬†as more granularly configurable versions of their equivalent TypeScript compiler options.

## Is ESLint useful with TypeScript?

**Yes.**

If you are using TypeScript, it is still very useful to use ESLint.
In fact, ESLint and¬†TypeScript are at their most powerful when used in conjunction with each other.

### ESLint with type information

Traditional ESLint rules run on a single file at a time and have no knowledge of other files in the project.
They can't make decisions on files based on the contents of other files.

However, if your project is set up using TypeScript, you can opt into "type checked" lint rules: rules that can pull in type information.
In doing so, type checked lint rules can make decisions based on other files.

For example, [`@typescript-eslint/no-for-in-array`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-for-in-array) is able to detect `for...in` loops over values that are array types, even if the values come from other files.
TypeScript would not report a type error for a `for...in` loop over an array because doing so is technically type-safe and might be what a developer intended.
A linter, however, could be configured to notice that the developer probably made a mistake and meant to use a `for...of` loop instead:

```ts
// declare function getArrayOfNames(): string[];
import { getArrayOfNames } from "./my-names";

for (const name in getArrayOfNames()) {
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-for-in-array):
    // For-in loops over arrays skips holes, returns indices as strings,
    // and may visit the prototype chain or other enumerable properties.
    // Use a more robust iteration method such as for-of or array.forEach instead.
    console.log(name);
}
```

Typed linting comes at the cost of slowing down linting to roughly the speed of type-checking, but makes available a more powerful set of lint rules.
See [Typed Linting: The Most Powerful TypeScript Linting Ever](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/typed-linting) for more details on typed linting with typescript-eslint.

### TypeScript with linting

TypeScript adds extra complexity to JavaScript.
That complexity is often worth it, but any added complexity brings with it the potential for misuse.
ESLint is useful for stopping developers from making TypeScript-specific blunders in code.

For example, TypeScript's `{}` ("empty object") type is often misused by developers new to TypeScript.
It visually looks like it should mean any `object`, but actually means any non-`null`, non-`undefined` value --- including primitives such as `number`s and `string`s.
[`@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-empty-object-type) catches uses of the `{}` type that likely meant `object` or `unknown` instead:

```ts
export function logObjectEntries(value: {}) {
    //                                  ~~
    // eslint(@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type):
    // The `{}` ("empty object") type allows any non-nullish value, including literals like `0` and `""`.
    // - If that's what you want, disable this lint rule with an inline comment or configure the 'allowObjectTypes' rule option.
    // - If you want a type meaning "any object", you probably want `object` instead.
    // - If you want a type meaning "any value", you probably want `unknown` instead.
    console.log(Object.entries(value));
}

logObjectEntries(0); // No type error!
```

Enforcing language-specific best practices with ESLint helps developers learn about and correctly use TypeScript.

## Conclusion

Linters such as ESLint and type checkers such as TypeScript are both valuable assets for developers.
The two catch different areas of code defects and come with different philosophies around configurability and extensibility.

* ESLint checks that code adheres to best practices and is consistent, enforcing what you *should* write.
* TypeScripts checks that code is "type-safe", enforcing what you *can* write.

Put together, the two tools help projects write code with fewer bugs and more consistency.
We recommend that any project that uses TypeScript additionally uses ESLint.
