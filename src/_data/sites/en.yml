      description: >
        ESLint must be written with a capital E, S and L when used, as “ES” stands
        for ECMAScript and “L” being the start of the word “Lint”.
    logo:
      title: Logo
      description:
        - >
          The ESLint logo can be placed on various backgrounds, provided it has
          enough vertical and horizontal padding.
        - >
          Double the size of the inner hexagon created by the gap to get an idea
          how much space the logo should have between the logo and wordmark, as
          well as around the logo itself.
        - >
          Our logo is versatile - you can use it on various brand colours, making
          use of opacity on non-white backgrounds to emulate the lighter colour.
          The ESLint logomark can also be used in isolation, without the ESLint
          wordmark though where possible, using both is preferred.

      description:
        - >
          ESLint’s colour palette can speak to our brand in ways that are every
          bit as powerful as copy and logos. They not only affect how our design
          looks, but can go as far as to elicit emotion and reflect the
          personality of the ESLint brand.
        - >
          The primary "brand" color is used across all interactive elements such
          as buttons, links, inputs, etc. It is derived from our logo. We use the
          two existing colors to create a unique primary tonal range.

    title: How the money is used
    subtitle: >
      The ESLint project uses donated money to benefit the project and the ESLint community as a whole.
      In general, we spend money on these areas each month.
    items:
      - name: Team Development
        text: >
          We pay our team members an hourly rate based on their seniority, currently HOURLY_RATE_TSC USD/hour
          for TSC members and Reviewers and HOURLY_RATE_COMMITERS USD/hour for committers.
      - name: Contributor Pool
        text: >
          We set aside CONTRIBUTOR_POOL_BUDGET USD each month to pay outside contributors who have made significant
          contributions to the project. Contributions include submitting code, writing documentation,
          answering questions in our Discord server, and more. This money is allocated each month by the TSC.
      - name: Dependencies
        text: >
          We set aside DEPENDENCIES_BUDGET USD each month to help support our dependencies.
          We believe that open source projects who are lucky enough to get funded
          have a responsibility to help support the smaller projects they rely on.
      - name: Community Projects
        text: >
          We set aside COMMUNITY_BUDGET USD each month to help support plugins, parsers,
          and other projects that are of benefit to the ESLint ecosystem as a whole.
          We believe the strength of the project is in its ecosystem and we want
          to ensure important projects remain well-maintained.
      - name: Support Systems
        text: >
          We use a small amount each month to pay for software the team uses to help manage
          the project, which includes things like Google Workspace and cloud storage.
    footer:
      text: >
        Additionally, from time to time we use the funds to pay contractors to work on things
        that are important to the project and where the team doesn’t have the time or expertise
        to complete the work on their own. For example, we recently hired a designer and developer
        to redesign this website. We ensure that we spend less than we take in each month so we
        can save for such projects.

        ESLint has been critical in helping developers write high-quality JavaScript
        for years. We love that it catches common issues early and often. With a high
        level of extensibility, ESLint's ability to let teams enforce custom rules that
        work for them has been excellent for open-source projects and more. Chrome is
        happy to sponsor ESLint to help web developers write consistently high-quality
        code. It's an essential piece of the modern web development toolkit.

        ESLint is an extremely useful tool for any JavaScript project. This tool allows
        us to set up consistent code formatting rules adopted by the whole team from the
        beginning of the project, greatly facilitates code reviews, and makes it easy
        to integrate new developers into the team. I know I am not alone in appreciating
        its flexibility and ease-of-use.

        Most JavaScript projects directly or transitively depend on ESLint. An Indeed
        employee nominated ESLint to receive a donation from the FOSS Contributor Fund,
        and their colleagues clearly agreed. We're happy to support the open source technologies
        that allow us to develop, protect, and maintain the digital infrastructure that
        supports our products and helps people get jobs.

        across a growing number of codebases and engineers. We are grateful for all the
        open-source projects that are helping us build Contra, and ESLint is the first
        of many open-source projects that we are committed to back.


  faq:
    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    description: Everything you need to know about the product and billing. Can’t find the answer you’re looking for? Please chat to our friendly team.
    items:
    - q: Who receives the money that is donated?
      a: All contributions, whether donated through <a href='https://opencollective.com'>Open
        Collective</a> or GitHub, are received by the Open Source Collective, which is
        a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization. The Open Source Collective acts as a fiscal
        host for ESLint and keeps track of all donations.
    - q: Will I get a record of my donations?
      a: Yes. If you donate through Open Collective, you will receive a PDF receipt via
        email; if you donate through GitHub, the donation will appear on your receipt
        or invoice.
    - q: Is my donation tax deductible?
      a: No. Even though the Open Source Collective is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization,
        the IRS doesn't consider development of open source software to be a charitable
        activity and therefore doesn’t grant tax-exempt status.
    - q: Who decides how the money is distributed?
      a: The TSC makes all decisions regarding who receives the money and how much is
        distributed.
    - q: Can I see how the money is being used?
      a: Yes. By going to our Open Collective page, you can see every expense that has
        been submitted and paid. All transactions are completely open and publicly visible.
    - q: Can I cancel my recurring donation at any time?
      a: Yes. There is no long-term commitment. You can cancel your donation at any time
        by logging into either Open Collective or GitHub sponsors.
    - q: How long does it take for my logo to appear on the homepage, GitHub, and npm
        package?
      a: The logos on the homepage and GitHub are automatically updated every day so it
        should take no longer than 24 hours to appear. The logos on the npm package are
        only updated when we publish a new release, which is typically every two weeks.
        However, major releases often take several months to complete and during that
        time logos on the npm package will not be updated.
    - q: Where do my logo and URL come from?
      a: We pull the logo and URL from your Open Collective or GitHub profiles, depending
        on which site you used to donate. You can update these at any time from within
        Open Collective or GitHub and those changes will be reflected on the homepage
        and GitHub README within 24 hours. We aren't able to manually override logos or
        URLs on the site.
    - q: Is it possible to make a one-time donation?
      a: Yes. The easiest way to make a one-time donation is through Open Collective,
        which allows any amount. GitHub one-time donations may have a limit on the amount
        you can donate.
