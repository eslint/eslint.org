        Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are 
        syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional 
        find-and-replace algorithms.

        ESLint has been critical in helping developers write high-quality JavaScript
        for years. We love that it catches common issues early and often. With a high
        level of extensibility, ESLint's ability to let teams enforce custom rules that
        work for them has been excellent for open-source projects and more. Chrome is
        happy to sponsor ESLint to help web developers write consistently high-quality
        code. It's an essential piece of the modern web development toolkit.

        Nx uses ESLint to enforce code quality, library boundaries, and project visibility
        constraints. ESLint makes Nx more powerful, so on behalf of the Nx.dev community,
        we're proud to do our part and sponsor ESLint's continued success!

        ESLint is an extremely useful tool for any JavaScript project. This tool allows
        us to set up consistent code formatting rules adopted by the whole team from the
        beginning of the project, greatly facilitates code reviews, and makes it easy
        to integrate new developers into the team. I know I am not alone in appreciating
        its flexibility and ease-of-use.

      text: >
        Most JavaScript projects directly or transitively depend on ESLint. An Indeed
        employee nominated ESLint to receive a donation from the FOSS Contributor Fund,
        and their colleagues clearly agreed. We're happy to support the open source technologies
        that allow us to develop, protect, and maintain the digital infrastructure that
        supports our products and helps people get jobs.

        ESLint plays a major role in helping us create a safe and consistent experience
        across a growing number of codebases and engineers. We are grateful for all the
        open-source projects that are helping us build Contra, and ESLint is the first
        of many open-source projects that we are committed to back.

    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    description: Everything you need to know about the product and billing. Canâ€™t find the answer youâ€™re looking for? Please chat to our friendly team.
    items:
    - q: Who receives the money that is donated?
      a: All contributions, whether donated through <a href='https://opencollective.com'>Open
        Collective</a> or GitHub, are received by the Open Source Collective, which is
        a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The Open Source Collective acts as a fiscal
        host for ESLint and keeps track of all donations.
    - q: Will I get a record of my donations?
      a: Yes. If you donate through Open Collective, you will receive a PDF receipt via
        email; if you donate through GitHub, the donation will appear on your receipt
        or invoice.
    - q: Is my donation tax deductible?
      a: No. Even though the Open Source Collective is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization,
        the IRS doesn't consider development of open source software to be a charitable
        activity and therefore doesnâ€™t grant tax-exempt status.
    - q: Who decides how the money is distributed?
      a: The TSC makes all decisions regarding who receives the money and how much is
        distributed.
    - q: Can I see how the money is being used?
      a: Yes. By going to our Open Collective page, you can see every expense that has
        been submitted and paid. All transactions are completely open and publicly visible.
    - q: Can I cancel my recurring donation at any time?
      a: Yes. There is no long-term commitment. You can cancel your donation at any time
        by logging into either Open Collective or GitHub sponsors.
    - q: How long does it take for my logo to appear on the homepage, GitHub, and npm
        package?
      a: The logos on the homepage and GitHub are automatically updated every day so it
        should take no longer than 24 hours to appear. The logos on the npm package are
        only updated when we publish a new release, which is typically every two weeks.
        However, major releases often take several months to complete and during that
        time logos on the npm package will not be updated.
    - q: Where do my logo and URL come from?
      a: We pull the logo and URL from your Open Collective or GitHub profiles, depending
        on which site you used to donate. You can update these at any time from within
        Open Collective or GitHub and those changes will be reflected on the homepage
        and GitHub README within 24 hours. We aren't able to manually override logos or
        URLs on the site.
    - q: Is it possible to make a one-time donation?
      a: Yes. The easiest way to make a one-time donation is through Open Collective,
        which allows any amount. GitHub one-time donations may have a limit on the amount
        you can donate.
